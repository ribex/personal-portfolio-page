  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>
    <p>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</p>
    <p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. It's art! <strong> A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?</strong> <em>'!</em> You've swallowed a planet!</p>
    <p>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</p>
    <p>I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</li><li>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</li><li>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>
    <p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</p>

      <li>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</li><li>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</li><li>No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</li>

    <p>You've swallowed a planet! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You hit me with a cricket bat. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>
    <p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</p>

    <p>Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
    <p>You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Saving the world with meals on wheels. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.</p>
    <p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</p>
