		<h2>About Me</h2>


		<article>
			<p>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You hate me; you
			want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! No… It's a thing; it's like
			a plan, but with more greatness. The way I see it, every life is a pile of
			good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad
			things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good
			things and make them unimportant.</p>


			<p>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum
			time! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every
			time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I'm nobody's taxi service;
			I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of
			a spaceship.</p>


			<p>I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And
			that is not how I'm introducing myself. You know when grown-ups tell you
			'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make
			you feel better?</p>


			<ol>
				<li>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so
				don't lie to me!</li>


				<li>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call
				me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</li>


				<li>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</li>
			</ol>


			<p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so
			don't lie to me! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him:
			Jeff. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</p>


			<ul>
				<li>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</li>


				<li>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</li>


				<li>No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No,
				I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</li>
